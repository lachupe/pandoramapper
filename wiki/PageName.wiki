= How to start it? How to connect ? =
_I downloaded the mapper, what do i do now?_

You just have to unpack the mapper and click on/start the pandora.exe file. Then you start your client and connect to localhost 3000.
JMC:
#connect localhost 3000

powwow/powtty
#connect main localhost 3000

Then you just log in the chareter of your choise and make sure you turn on the XML mode. You can do it by: change xml on.

If the XML mode is already on you will see it in the first MUME room input. (Inn room)


= Which shortkey are available? =

F11 and F12 are very useful - you can turn on/off both statusbar and menubar. This makes mapper window smaller.

spacebar - turn on the Movement tool. This means if you hold spacebar and click left or right mouse button you can change some settings of the camera.

The following hotkeys also affect the camera:
q,w
a,s
y,x
pageUp, pageDown

mouseWheel zooms in/out

You can change your current layer (i.e. you can highlight the layers above or below the current one) just by pressing Plus/Minus on your numpad.
